# Bank-Loan-Analysis

## **Objective**
This project aims to develop an interactive analytics dashboard for monitoring loan performance and extracting valuable insights. The dashboard will feature Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), dynamic grid views, and data visualizations to help financial analysts and loan officers make data-driven decisions.

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

**1.	Total Loan Applications**
   
•	Calculate the total number of loan applications received within a specified period.

•	Track Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications to measure recent application trends.

•	Monitor Month-over-Month (MoM) changes to analyze loan application growth or decline.

**2.	Total Funded Amount**
   
•	Measure the total funds disbursed as loans over a given period.

•	Track the MTD Total Funded Amount to assess recent loan disbursements.

•	Analyze MoM variations to understand changes in loan funding trends.

4.	Total Amount Received
•	Monitor the total repayments collected from borrowers.
•	Evaluate the MTD Total Amount Received to track recent collections.
•	Observe MoM changes to identify repayment patterns and trends.
5.	Average Interest Rate
•	Calculate the average interest rate across all loans.
•	Track MTD Average Interest Rate to assess recent loan costs.
•	Monitor MoM fluctuations to analyze changes in lending rates.
6.	Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
•	Evaluate the average DTI of borrowers to gauge their financial health.
•	Compute MTD DTI to track recent borrower affordability.
•	Analyze MoM changes to assess financial risk trends.
